## PHASE I: IDEATION
### Prospectus - 

This project will be a series of exploratory data visualizations on Valentine's Day spending trends in the United States. Overall, it will seek to answer the following questions: How much are people spending on Valentine's Day? Who are the ones spending this money and what are they buying? The data that will be depicted are from the National Retail Federation (https://nrf.com) and are intended for the general public. The data shown will be accompanied with context so that the average layperson will be able to understand.
