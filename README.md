## PHASE II: BRAINSTORMING + SKETCHES 
### Brainstorming - 

The three directions I intend to take with visualizing Valentine's Day spending trends are the following: 1) How much money is being spent, 2) Who are the gifts for, and 3) What gifts are being purchased? Because I have a mix of nominal and continuous data, I am choosing to utilize a bar charts, tree map, and area chart (to represent time trends). I intend on having 3 separate graphs all of which will have either an interaction (e.g., dropdown) or transition.

Mockup for code of the area chart is on main.js 

## PHASE I: IDEATION
### Prospectus - 

This project will be a series of exploratory data visualizations on Valentine's Day spending trends in the United States. Overall, it will seek to answer the following questions: How much are people spending on Valentine's Day? Who are the ones spending this money and what are they buying? The data that will be depicted are from the National Retail Federation (https://nrf.com) and are intended for the general public. The data shown will be accompanied with context so that the average layperson will be able to understand.
